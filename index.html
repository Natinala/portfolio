                <h1>WORK EXPERIENCE</h1>
            <p>Data Engineer
            BIAr Consulting – Oct 2022 – Aug 2024
            In this role, I was responsible for designing and developing custom data views and reports to support strategic decision-making within the organization. To enable stakeholders to understand and analyze results over time, I implemented Excel-based reports with clearly defined execution periods, making it possible for teams to track performance metrics effectively. 
            I developed and maintained data pipelines using PL/SQL in the PowerCenter environment, supporting a wide range of reporting and analytics workflows. A significant part of this work involved migrating database systems, translating complex PL/SQL queries to PostgreSQL to ensure functional parity and optimized performance across platforms. 
            Additionally, I contributed to the transition of the company’s data infrastructure to AWS, collaborating closely with the team to design and implement scalable, cloud-based ETL solutions. 

            Data Engineer Junior
            IBM – Jul 2022 to Oct 2022
            In this role, I further developed my expertise in data engineering by focusing on data mapping techniques and streamlining development workflows. I leveraged Azure DevOps to manage version control and streamline collaboration across teams, ensuring seamless and structured deployment of data solutions. This position deepened my understanding of database design and operational best practices for data engineering projects.

            Internship at IBM – Mar 2022 to Jun 2022
            During this internship, I focused on analyzing and managing large datasets using Python and the Pandas library 
            within Jupyter Notebook environments. I gained hands-on experience extracting, cleaning, and structuring data to 
            support business analysis and reporting needs. As part of the role, I led the creation of automated dashboards using 
            Looker Studio, which allowed stakeholders to explore and understand data visually. This experience strengthened my 
            technical proficiency in Python and data visualization, while also reinforcing the importance of translating complex 
            information into actionable insights.
